            <h3>   Mission Statement:   </h3>
            <p1>
            Have you ever annoyed when your family members asked you for tech support because you are young and seem to know about computer? <br>
            Have you ever needed to explain to your best friend the difference between an 13in computer and 15in computer? <br>
            Have you ever shouted at someone for buying a Macbook for gaming? <br>
            Well, all of that is no more. <br>
            <br>
            I introduce, <br>
            <br>
            TECH INSIGHT <br>

            <p1>
            We wish to provide the best service we could surrounding these core ideas:
            </p1> <br>

            <li>Cost efficient: A diversity of products meant to fit your budget.</li> <br>
            <li>Reliability: Route the user directly to the product’s company’s website.</li> <br>
